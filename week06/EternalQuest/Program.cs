/*
 * CSE 210 - Programming with Classes
 * Eternal Quest Program
 * 
 * CREATIVITY AND EXCEEDING REQUIREMENTS:
 * 
 * 1. LEVELING SYSTEM: Implemented a comprehensive leveling system where players gain levels 
 *    every 1000 points. Each level comes with a unique title that progresses from "Novice Dreamer" 
 *    to "Divine Achievement God" and beyond.
 * 
 * 2. DYNAMIC TITLES: Created 12+ unique player titles that change based on level, making the 
 *    experience more engaging and providing long-term motivation.
 * 
 * 3. LEVEL-UP CELEBRATIONS: Added special notifications when players level up with celebratory 
 *    emojis and announcements.
 * 
 * 4. ENHANCED USER INTERFACE: 
 *    - Added welcome message with thematic language
 *    - Display current level and title in player info
 *    - Show points needed to reach next level
 *    - Added celebratory messages for goal completion
 * 
 * 5. ROBUST ERROR HANDLING: Implemented comprehensive error handling for file operations,
 *    invalid inputs, and edge cases to prevent program crashes.
 * 
 * 6. SPECIAL CELEBRATIONS: Added bonus celebration messages for checklist goal completions
 *    with festive emojis to make achievements feel more rewarding.
 * 
 * 7. IMPROVED GOAL TRACKING: Enhanced the checklist goal display to show exact progress
 *    (e.g., "Currently completed: 2/5") for better user feedback.
 * 
 * This implementation goes beyond the core requirements by adding significant gamification
 * elements that make goal tracking more engaging and motivating for users.
